DR Components and Implementation
1. Multi-Region Database Strategy
Primary Setup

Cloud SQL instance with high availability configuration
Automated backups scheduled every 4 hours
Point-in-time recovery enabled
Transaction logs continuously exported to Cloud Storage

Implementation
hcl# terraform/modules/cloudsql/main.tf
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "instance" {
  name             = var.instance_name
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region
  
  settings {
    tier = "db-n1-standard-2"
    
    backup_configuration {
      enabled            = true
      binary_log_enabled = true
      start_time         = "02:00"
      location           = "us"
      
      backup_retention_settings {
        retained_backups = 7
        retention_unit   = "COUNT"
      }
    }
    
    availability_type = "REGIONAL"
    
    maintenance_window {
      day          = 7
      hour         = 3
      update_track = "stable"
    }
  }
  
  deletion_protection = true
}

# Cross-region replica
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "replica" {
  name                 = "${var.instance_name}-replica"
  database_version     = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region               = var.dr_region
  master_instance_name = google_sql_database_instance.instance.name
  
  replica_configuration {
    failover_target = false
  }
  
  settings {
    tier              = "db-n1-standard-1"
    availability_type = "ZONAL"
  }
  
  deletion_protection = true
}
2. Stateful Data Protection
Static Content and File Storage

Multi-regional Cloud Storage buckets
Object versioning enabled to prevent accidental deletions
Regular lifecycle policies for cost optimization

Implementation
hcl# terraform/modules/storage/main.tf
resource "google_storage_bucket" "static_assets" {
  name          = var.bucket_name
  location      = "US"
  storage_class = "MULTI_REGIONAL"
  
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  
  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 30
    }
    action {
      type = "SetStorageClass"
      storage_class = "NEARLINE"
    }
  }
  
  uniform_bucket_level_access = true
}
3. Application Resilience
Primary Components

Cloud Run services deployed across multiple regions
Global load balancer for traffic routing and failover
Health checks for automatic service detection

Implementation
hcl# terraform/modules/cloudrun/main.tf
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "primary" {
  name     = var.service_name
  location = var.region
  
  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = var.image_url
      }
    }
  }
  
  traffic {
    percent         = 100
    latest_revision = true
  }
}

resource "google_cloud_run_service" "secondary" {
  name     = "${var.service_name}-dr"
  location = var.dr_region
  
  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = var.image_url
      }
    }
  }
  
  traffic {
    percent         = 100
    latest_revision = true
  }
}
4. Network and DNS Failover

Cloud DNS with health-based routing
Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer with automatic failover
Network path monitoring and rerouting

Implementation
hcl# terraform/modules/loadbalancer/main.tf
resource "google_compute_global_address" "default" {
  name = "global-app-ip"
}

resource "google_compute_health_check" "default" {
  name = "http-health-check"
  
  http_health_check {
    port = 80
  }
}

resource "google_compute_backend_service" "default" {
  name                  = "backend-service"
  protocol              = "HTTP"
  port_name             = "http"
  load_balancing_scheme = "EXTERNAL"
  health_checks         = [google_compute_health_check.default.id]
  
  backend {
    group = google_compute_region_network_endpoint_group.primary.id
  }
  
  backend {
    group = google_compute_region_network_endpoint_group.secondary.id
  }
  
  failover_policy {
    disable_connection_drain_on_failover = false
    drop_traffic_if_unhealthy            = true
    failover_ratio                       = 1.0
  }
}
Disaster Recovery Procedures
1. Database Failover
Automated Failover
Cloud SQL with high availability will automatically promote a standby instance in case of a primary instance failure within the same region.
Cross-Region Failover
For a regional outage, manual intervention is required:
bash#!/bin/bash
# dr_database_failover.sh

# Promote replica to primary
gcloud sql instances promote-replica ${INSTANCE_NAME}-replica \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}

# Update connection strings
kubectl set env deployment/php-app \
  DB_HOST=${INSTANCE_NAME}-replica.${PROJECT_ID}.cloudsql \
  --namespace=production
2. Application Recovery
Automated Recovery

Health checks will detect failed instances and remove them from the load balancer
Auto-scaling will replace failed instances
Traffic will be automatically routed to the secondary region

Manual Intervention (if needed)
bash#!/bin/bash
# dr_app_failover.sh

# Scale down primary region
gcloud run services update-traffic ${SERVICE_NAME} \
  --to-revisions=LATEST=0 \
  --region=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}

# Scale up secondary region
gcloud run services update-traffic ${SERVICE_NAME}-dr \
  --to-revisions=LATEST=100 \
  --region=${DR_REGION} \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}

# Update load balancer
gcloud compute backend-services update backend-service \
  --global \
  --no-enable-backend \
  --backend-service-backend=group=${PRIMARY_NEG_NAME} \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}

gcloud compute backend-services update backend-service \
  --global \
  --enable-backend \
  --backend-service-backend=group=${SECONDARY_NEG_NAME} \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}

Validation Process

Pre-Test: Document current state, prepare rollback plan
Execute Test: Run the predetermined DR scenario
Validate: Verify application functionality and data integrity
Document: Record metrics (actual RTO/RPO) and identified issues
Review: Update DR plan based on findings

Monitoring and Alerting
Key Metrics to Monitor

Database replication lag
Backup success/failure status
Cross-region latency
Service health status

Implementation
hcl# terraform/modules/monitoring/main.tf
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "replication_lag" {
  display_name = "Database Replication Lag"
  
  conditions {
    display_name = "Replication lag exceeding threshold"
    
    condition_threshold {
      filter     = "metric.type=\"cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/replication/lag\" resource.type=\"cloudsql_database\""
      duration   = "60s"
      comparison = "COMPARISON_GT"
      threshold_value = 300  # 5 minutes in seconds
    }
  }
  
  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.email.name]
  
  alert_strategy {
    auto_close = "1800s"  # Auto-close after 30 minutes
  }
}

Continuous Improvement
This DR strategy is a living document that should be regularly reviewed and updated based on:

Technology Evolution: Adopt new GCP DR features as they become available
Business Requirements: Adjust RTO/RPO as business needs evolve
Test Results: Incorporate findings from regular DR testing
Incident Learnings: Update procedures based on actual incident responses

This DR strategy ensures that our PHP application can quickly recover from various disaster scenarios while minimizing data loss and downtime. By leveraging GCP's global infrastructure and built-in DR capabilities, we can maintain business continuity even during significant service disruptions.
